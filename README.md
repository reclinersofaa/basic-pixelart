Made a simple and basic pixelart website. 

Existing functionalities: 
* Color selection
* Set grid size (default being 16)
* Set borders into the grid to help with which box is colored
* Reset the grid 

Functionalities that I wanna add later: 
* Randomized Color Sets
* Option to color on continuous left click
* Option to color on hover
* Gradients (darker coloring on further actions on a colored box)
